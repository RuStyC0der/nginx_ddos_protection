this is test to discover how type of storage impacts performance
i used default unconfigured nginx in most cases

case1:
    environment: home pc (6-core cpu. 500000 iops storage)
    conf: default page
    description: nginx with stdout as log file (with docker)
    load: 80 threads with 700 connections
    rate 43000 - 46000 req/sec

case2:
    environment: home pc (6-core cpu. 500000 iops storage)
    conf: default page
    description: nginx with /dev/null as log file (aka no log)
    load: 80 threads with 700 connections
    rate: 100k - 115k req/sec

case3:
    environment: home pc (6-core cpu. 500000 iops storage)
    conf: default page
    description: nginx with file on fs as log file (fast ssd)
    load: 80 threads with 700 connections
    rate: 88k - 92k req/sec

case4:
    environment: home pc (6-core cpu. 500000 iops storage)
    conf: default page
    description: nginx with /dev/shm as log file (aka log in RAM)
    load: 80 threads with 700 connections
    rate: 97k - 100k req/sec

case5:
    environment: aws ec2 (1-core 3000 iops storage)
    conf: default page
    description: nginx with stdin as log file (with docker)
    load: 80 threads with 700 connections
    rate: 1700 - 2000 req/sec

case6:
    environment: aws ec2 (1-core 3000 iops storage)
    conf: default page
    description: nginx with /dev/null as log file (aka no log)
    load: 80 threads with 700 connections
    rate: 7800 - 8000 req/sec

case7:
    environment: aws ec2 (1-core 3000 iops storage)
    conf: default page
    description: nginx with stdin as log file (with docker) (detached)
    load: 80 threads with 700 connections
    rate: 3300 - 3400 req/sec

case8:
    environment: aws ec2 (1-core 3000 iops storage)
    conf: default page
    description: nginx with /dev/shm as log file (aka log in RAM)
    load: 80 threads with 700 connections
    rate: 7200 - 7600 req/sec

case9:
    environment: aws ec2 (1-core 3000 iops storage)
    conf: default page
    description: nginx with file on fs as log file (aws ebs ssd)
    load: 80 threads with 700 connections
    rate: 6600 - 6700 req/sec

case10:
    environment: aws ec2 (1-core 3000 iops storage)
    conf: return 204 (no body)
    description: nginx with file on fs as log file (aws ebs ssd)
    load: 80 threads with 700 connections
    rate: 9100 - 9200 req/sec

case11:
    environment: aws ec2 (1-core 3000 iops storage)
    conf: return 204 (no body)
    description: nginx with file on fs as log file (aws ebs ssd) with buffering enabled (fuffer size is 64k)
    load: 80 threads with 700 connections
    rate: 10000 - 11000 req/sec

case12:
    environment: aws ec2 (1-core 3000 iops storage)
    conf: return 204 (no body)
    description: log off
    load: 80 threads with 700 connections
